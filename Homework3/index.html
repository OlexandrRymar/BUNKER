            Overvie You might think that 591 horsepower would be enough for the
            Audi RS6 Avant, but apparently, it was not. For 2024, Audi decided
            to crank the dial, replacing last year's RS6 Avant with a new
            Performance model that promises a ludicrous 621 ponies. The new
            variant also weighs less, so acceleration should prove sufficiently
            brutal. And yet, the RS6 Avant's search for more power changes
            nothing about its impressive practicality, comfortably seating five
            in an interior replete with rich materials and plenty of trendy
            technology. There's plenty of space to store cargo behind the power
            rear liftgate, too. The RS6 Avant remains a niche choice adrift in a
            sea of performance-oriented SUVs like the BMW X5 M, as the station
            wagon's only true competitor comes in the form of the Porsche
            Panamera Sport Turismo. While the curvaceous look of the Porsche may
            appeal to some, the RS6 Avant's brawny, hard-edged design is also
            one of its biggest selling points.
